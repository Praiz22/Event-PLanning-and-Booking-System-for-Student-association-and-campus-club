# Event-PLanning-and-Booking-System-for-Student-association-and-campus-club
this is a repository for an event planning and booking system created and developed by praixtech(2025) for the group3 of the information system class 27 swep project
 A modern Event Planning and Booking System for a Student Association and Campus Club using my signature UI design (clean, animated, responsive, minimal shadows, rounded cards, catchy fonts, floating backgrounds, and subtle transitions). Use Firebase as the backend for CRUD operations (venues, resources, bookings) and deploy it on Firebase Hosting. Authentication should only be for the Admin Panel, where admins can add/edit/delete venues, resources, and view bookings. Clients (students) do not need authenticationâ€”they can browse available venues/resources via carousel modals, select their preferred options (venue, projector, chairs, etc.), and submit bookings through a FormSubmit integration that captures details with timestamp. The system should include:

Landing page with event highlights and available venues (carousel style)

Booking form with venue selection, resources selection, and user details

Admin Panel with CRUD for venues/resources/bookings (secured login)

Responsive, animated UI optimized for desktop & mobile

Alternatives for any Cloud Function features (no paid plan required)
